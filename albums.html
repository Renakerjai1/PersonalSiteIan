		<h4>General points about the album</h4>
		<hr>
		<p> I think the one thing that every American of my generation has in common is two things: at one point everyone had a JUUL, and everyone has at least one pop punk album they find to be 10x better than the rest. That album for me is <i>Life's Not Out to Get You</i> by Neck Deep, the Welsh band that is bringing back Pop Punk single handedly. My friend, Dave, showed me this album while he came back to town for the birth of his nephew and while he was in town we were definitely going to be as ramubuntious as possible. I find this to be the perfect album for trashing in the afternoon and causing the most havoc. The songs are easily picked up by any passerby, guaranteeing that any of these absolute bangers will get stuck in their head for a couple days atleast. The energy that gets sent through your ears puts you in the mood to do whatever needs to be done that day. Ben Barlow, the lead singer, also puts inspiring songs that will lift you out of any slump you feel stuck in. The song "Gold Steps" that holds the title's name, tells about how we would not be human unless we find ourselves stopped by a brick wall a couple times in life. Nothing works out perfectly, it is only expected that we will have to fall down and get back up, then learning not to fall like that again. My personal favorite is a song called "December", which tells the story of how stupid Barlow was to let his old girlfriend go. The lyrics are not anything special, but Dave and I can scream every lyric perfectly filling our bodies with air that leaves behind true satisfaction. </p><!-- post script-->

		<h4>General points about the album</h4>
		<hr>
		<p> The long awaited album, <i>Father Of The Bride</i>, is the return of Ezra and his boys after a 6 year haitus. The band had broken up, Ezra made a weird show with Jaden smith and Steve Buschemi, then VW lost their producer. Despite it seeming like the band had reached the end, Ezra got Baio and CT to come give music writing another shot. To everyone's suprise, VW made their best album without the presence of their producer. Ezra somehow came up some of the most polarizing sounds and slammed them together in this grammy winning album. From "Harmony hall" to "Flower Moon", VW talks about everything from writing bad music, finding harmony in life, to suspecting our lives might be at the will of the gods. "This Life" and "Bambina" both have light, upbeat sounds that would make them great to listen to on your way to the ocean. Overall the album gives off a warming feeling that time is best spent having as much fun as we can. </p><!-- post script-->

		<h4>General points about the album</h4>
		<hr>
		<p>  To appropriately acknowledge the Psych Rock genre, it is necessary to address the contributions from My Morning Jacket. The greatest of My Morning jacket's work, without questions, is the album <i>Z</i>. It is very easy to hear the amount of work that Jim James, the singer, dumped into this album. From the top to the bottom of the list, the soul of James himself is sent directly into your ears. The unorthodox beats and sounds that come from this album send you into another world that you never want to leave. <i>Z</i> lifts you off your feat and Jim James is the angel that sends you up to the promised land which is his mind. Even hearing these songs live, the harmonies that James hit are what one can only expect to hear at the end of times. The true reach of sound in this album varies greatly, from the majestic "Wordless" to the eerie "Into the Woods". The album as a whole can only be related to the feeling of being blissfully lost in the woods during a cool spring day. Below is an American Dad skit that does a good job of summing up the beauty of Jim Jame's work </p><!-- post script-->

		<h4>Birthplace <small>by Novo Amor</small></h4>
		<p> Traits that describe the tone of the album </p>

			<li>Alternative Singer/Songwriter</li>
			<li>Alternative Soothing Folk</li>

		<h4>General points about the album</h4>
		<hr>
		<p>The sounds that comes out of Novo Amor's albums are all beautifully made to be listened to as one long piece. The album has a point to make that can only appropriately be made if listened to properly. <i>Birthplace</i> is a carefully written monologue covered in a warm blanket made from the sea of instruments the band uses. Many of the songs feel as if they are telling you to take the good with the bad that surrounds your life currently and weave the two together to tell a truly fascinating story after your head rises above the waters. It's a reminder that nothing can stay the same, that the only things that last are what we take the time and energy to cultivate. <i>Birthplace</i> is the spark in the back of your head to remind you of the good that can come from those worth caring for. This album wants us to remember that nothing is set in stone unless we want it to be and that just because something is gone does not make it lost. I always feel that Novo Amor's music is some of the hardest to cram into a genre due to its extremely unique nature. </p><!-- post script-->

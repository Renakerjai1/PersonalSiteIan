			<p class="text-center">Growing up I spent a lot of time helping my family in the kitchen; I still remember how proud I was when I was a kid when I had made my first omlette. With school I do not get as much time as I would like to spend on cooking, but I make do with occasional experimentation. I believe that the kitchen is one of the most important ways to strengthen family bonds. Recipies are a powerful form of storytelling that reminds us of the family and friends we have, easily turning a bad day into at least a decent one. Sadly none of the pictures below are actually food I've eaten, but they are almost picture perfect to what I have eaten and made. I would help create all these recipies as a kid and as a teenager with my family. </p>

			<p class="smallText">This was typically the meal that I had every sunday during my childhood when I went to my grandmother's house. Beef that was loaded in a pot with carrots, potatoes, and onions. Finally it was drowned in wine with a dash of beef stock. It was the unique flavor factor that was not present in any other German American household. When I was young I would help dump half a bottle of cheap wine into a large, glass tray full of beef and vegetables. Eventually the alcohol is cooked out and only sugar from fermented grapes are left to fill the vegetables and beef. This distinct flavor may just have been what influenced my love of wine, and I'm sure that would make my grandmother proud to hear. </p>

			<p class="smallText">I grew up with a family that has its branches spread quite wide. Growing up my Filipino aunt would commonly make us food from her hometown and I would look forward every Christmas to getting these crispy flakey spring rolls. Commonly they were filled with carrots, cabbage, and bamboo shoots, occasionally there would also be cilantro and mint. My christmas season now feels incomplete without the presence of springrolls and since my Aunt no longer has the time like she did I try to find a substitution each year. Hopefully next Christmas I can have time to get the recipe from her and try to make them as best as I can. I've always found that my love of oriental food probably would not exist without my Aunt, and I greatly thank her for that.  </p>

			<hr>
			<p class="smallText">Before my Aunt's unexpecting passing while I was in highschool, she used to make multiple different foods for everyone in the community. Of the many foods she made, none were as good as her golden apples. To this day no one really knows how she made them and sadly I do not think that we ever will. The memory of their taste still sits in the back of my head and I have been trying desperately to recreate that distinct flavor. The apples themselves were a bit crispy on the outside from the sugar, cinnamon, and honey that would delicately coat it. Once you took a bite your mouth felt like liquid gold had blessed your taste buds.The juicy flavor washed through your mouth like a tsunami, there was no escaping the desire to have another. Every birthday she would make these and bring along a weird little gift, the first birthday I was not able to have these I felt as though it was not even worth celebrating. I hope that one day I will be able to recreate this priceless recipe and be able to share it with all my friends and loved ones. </p>
